 * When creating an account, it is often required that the password should fulfil some strength
 * requirements. It should be X characters long, have at least Y digits, contain underscore, hash, and
 * a mixture of lower and capital letters, etc. Your task is to write a method that will validate a given
 * password. The set of rules (requirements) with which you will be verifying the passwords is up to you.
